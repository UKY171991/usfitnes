# PathLab Pro Logo Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Logo Detection Function (`includes/init.php`)
- Improved `getLogoPath()` function to properly detect logo files
- Added multiple fallback paths for different directory contexts
- Fixed path resolution issues that were preventing logo detection

### 2. Enhanced Navbar Display (`includes/navbar.php`)
- Added proper fallback display when logo is not available
- Shows microscope icon and "PathLab Pro" text when logo file is missing
- Maintains consistent styling for both logo and fallback text

### 3. Improved Sidebar Branding (`includes/sidebar.php`)
- Added microscope icon fallback for sidebar brand link
- Proper styling for both logo and text-only display
- Better visual hierarchy when logo is not available

### 4. Enhanced CSS Styling (`css/custom.css`)
- Added logo fallback styles with hover effects
- Smooth transitions for logo and icon interactions
- Consistent color scheme using CSS custom properties

### 5. Fixed Broken Logo File (`img/logo.svg`)
- Replaced corrupted SVG file with properly formatted version
- Maintained original design with gradient background
- Ensured cross-browser compatibility

## Logo Display Logic

The system now works as follows:

1. **If logo file exists**: Shows the logo image
2. **If logo file is missing**: Shows fallback text with microscope icon

### Fallback Display Components:
- **Icon**: `<i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>`
- **Text**: "PathLab Pro" 
- **Styling**: Consistent colors and fonts matching the brand

## Files Modified:
- `includes/init.php` - Logo detection functions
- `includes/navbar.php` - Public navigation logo display
- `includes/sidebar.php` - Admin sidebar logo display
- `includes/header.php` - Already had proper logo handling
- `css/custom.css` - Logo styling enhancements
- `img/logo.svg` - Fixed corrupted logo file

## Testing
All logo display contexts have been tested:
- Public homepage navigation
- Admin dashboard sidebar
- Login page preloader
- All fallback scenarios work correctly

The system now gracefully handles both scenarios:
- When logo files are available: Shows the logo
- When logo files are missing: Shows styled fallback text with icon
