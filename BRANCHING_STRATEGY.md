# PathLab Pro - Git Branching Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the branching strategy for the PathLab Pro pathology management system to support multiple development workflows and environments.

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches

#### 1. `main` (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires pull requests
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to production
- **Naming**: `main`

#### 2. `develop` (Development)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Testing**: Continuous integration testing
- **Deployment**: Deploys to development environment
- **Naming**: `develop`

### Supporting Branches

#### 3. `staging` (Pre-production)
- **Purpose**: Final testing before production
- **Testing**: User acceptance testing
- **Deployment**: Staging environment
- **Naming**: `staging`

## Workflow Process

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/patient-management

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add patient registration functionality"
git push origin feature/patient-management

# Create pull request to develop
```

### 2. Release Process
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Final testing and bug fixes
git commit -m "Prepare v1.0.0 release"

# Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git tag v1.0.0

git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.0.0
```

### 3. Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch

# Fix issue
git commit -m "Fix critical security vulnerability"

# Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/security-patch
git tag v1.0.1

git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/security-patch
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Creating PR
- [ ] Code is tested locally
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows PSR standards
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Database migrations included
- [ ] Security considerations reviewed

### PR Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Medical Compliance
- [ ] Patient data privacy maintained
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verified
- [ ] Audit trail preserved

## Database Changes
- [ ] Migration scripts included
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Data integrity verified
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to admins only
- Require signed commits

### Develop Branch
- Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow force pushes by admins

## Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hook
- Code style validation (PSR-12)
- Security scanning
- Database credential check
- Unit test execution

### Pre-push Hook
- Integration test execution
- Vulnerability scanning
- Documentation generation

## Deployment Strategy

### Automated Deployment
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy PathLab Pro

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, staging]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to environment
        run: |
          if [[ $GITHUB_REF == 'refs/heads/main' ]]; then
            echo "Deploying to production"
          elif [[ $GITHUB_REF == 'refs/heads/staging' ]]; then
            echo "Deploying to staging"
          elif [[ $GITHUB_REF == 'refs/heads/develop' ]]; then
            echo "Deploying to development"
          fi
```

## Version Tagging

### Semantic Versioning
- `v1.0.0` - Major release
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release (new features)
- `v1.1.1` - Patch release (bug fixes)

### Tag Format
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "PathLab Pro v1.0.0 - Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Team Collaboration

### Code Review Process
1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Implements changes with tests
3. Creates pull request
4. Team lead reviews code
5. Medical expert reviews compliance
6. Merge after approval

### Communication
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers
- Document breaking changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug Fix
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Fix issue with minimal changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy immediately
5. Merge back to develop

### Rollback Process
1. Identify last stable version
2. Revert to previous tag
3. Communicate with team
4. Create fix in separate branch

This branching strategy ensures proper code management, testing, and deployment for the PathLab Pro pathology management system while maintaining medical data integrity and compliance standards.
